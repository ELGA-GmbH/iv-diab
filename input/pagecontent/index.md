The **logical model of "Diabetes"** has been based on the framework concept for diabetes mellitus type 2:

- [Ãœbersicht Diabetes](StructureDefinition-Uebersicht-diab.html)

Correspondingly, a **logical model based on the [International Patient Summary (IPS)](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-ips)** has been created in order to line out which modules of the IPS would be required to resemble the logical model of diabetes.

- [Subject (IPS)](StructureDefinition-Subject-ips.html)
- [Medication Summary (IPS)](StructureDefinition-MedicationSummary-ips.html)
- [Allergies and Intolerances (IPS)](StructureDefinition-AllergiesIntolerances-ips.html)
- [Problem List (IPS)](StructureDefinition-ProblemList-ips.html)
- [Diagnostic Results (IPS)](StructureDefinition-DiagnosticResults-ips.html)
- [Vital Signs (IPS)](StructureDefinition-VitalSigns-ips.html)
- [Plan of Care (IPS)](StructureDefinition-PlanOfCare-ips.html)

Refer to the **[mapping from the logical model of diabetes to the logical model based on the IPS](mappings.html)** in order to get an idea how the IPS can be used in this context.
